URL STRUCTURE #################################################################

So this is how LiveABC sorts their vocabulary flashcard pdf files. Fortunately,
no login is required to scrape their teacher resources. So much for security.

kids.liveabc.com/placementtest/flashcards/b^u*.pdf

The ^ can be a single digit from 0 to 8, representing the book number. Book 0
is officially called Starter.

The * can be a single digit from 1 to 9, representing a unit of the book.


FILE STRUCTURE ################################################################

Every pdf file has an even number of pages. The odd-numbered pages contain the
images and the even-numbered pages contain English word(s) describing the
picture on the previous odd-numbered page.


PICTURE STRUCTURE #############################################################

There appears to be a single large jpeg file comprising a circular image on a
blue background. There is a rounded, dashed border around the image that appears
to be a vector of some sort and another similar black border further towards the
edge of the paper. The is a text object on top of the lower-right corner of each
picture that serves as a file name for the individual card.


VOCABULARY STRUCTURE ##########################################################

The vocabulary has a similar overall layout the images. Words are large text
objects. Verbs are occasionally accompanied by thier past tense within
parentheses and a red character color. Although some vocabulary requires two
lines, there do not appear to be explicit newline characters.
