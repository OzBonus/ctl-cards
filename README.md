Download the complete collection of Come to Live flashcards and create a small, cropped, JPEG version of each card for use in worksheets, etc. Now there's one fewer reason to ever visit that website again.

The complete set of cards comes to about 470MB. The JPEG conversions are about 36MB.

Requires the MagickWand library `libmagickwand-dev` which Debian users can get thusly:

    sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
