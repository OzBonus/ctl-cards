Download the complete collection of Come to Live flashcards and create a small, cropped, JPEG version of each card for use in worksheets, etc. Now there's one fewer reason to ever visit that awful website.

The complete set of cards comes to about 470MB. The JPEG conversions are just a few MB

Requires the MagickWand library `libmagickwand-dev`.
Debian users can get it thusly:

    sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
